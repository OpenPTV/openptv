liboptv - a library of openptv support code, for use in user-facing code.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a library - you need to build it and link to it in your own project.

Below are instructions for building it and making it ready for use, either from
a source distribution (a tarball with all necessary files) or directly from a 
Git repository.

When the package is installed correctly, you can reference it in your code by 
including files from the optv directory under the standard include path. For
example,

  #include <optv/tracking_frame_buf.h>

To build your program you also link it with liboptv. On gcc, one adds the flag
-loptv to the command line.


From a source distribution
--------------------------
If you received this library as a source tarball, it contains the necessary build 
instructions. Make sure you have the tools to build software on your computer 
(make and a compiler toolchain). Then run the following in the directory liboptv/

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make check

The later is optional, but seeing it run correctly informs you that no problems
were encountered during install.

From a Git repository
---------------------
From git, there's a preliminary step of generating the configure scripts. To 
do this you need to have the GNU autotools.

On linux, get them from the packages autoconf and automake:

  $ sudo apt-get autoconf # automake is a dependency

On mac, Alex recommended this:

  $ port install autoconf
  $ port install automake
  $ port install libtool
  $ port install pkgconfig

Once you have those, run:

  $ autoreconf --install

and then proceed with the instructions for running from a source distribution.
