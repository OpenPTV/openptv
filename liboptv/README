liboptv - a library of openptv support code, for use in user-facing code.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a library - you need to build it and link to it in your own project.

Below are instructions for building it and making it ready for use, either from
a source distribution (a tarball with all necessary files) or directly from a 
Git repository.

When the package is installed correctly, you can reference it in your code by 
including files from the optv directory under the standard include path. For
example,

  #include <optv/tracking_frame_buf.h>

To build your program you also link it with liboptv. On gcc, one adds the flag
-loptv to the command line. Other compilers and IDEs have their own 
instructions for adding libraries; consult your IDE/compiler manual for the 
details.
