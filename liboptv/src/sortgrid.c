Description:	       	reads objects, detected by detection etc.,
		       	sorts them with respect to the 13 wires of the grid,
		       	detects missing points
		       	and writes the result to  a new file
			
		       	does not work in each imaginable case !

/* sortgrid () is sorting detected target points by back-projection. Three dimensional 
    positions of the dots on the calibration target are provided with the known IDs. The 
    points are back-projected onto the image space and the nearest neighbour dots 
    identified by image processing routines are selected and sorted according to the 
    pre-defined IDs. The one to one correspondence provides a data on which the 
    calibration process is based on. The nearest neighbour search is a primitive 
    minimum distance search within a pre-defined radius (default = 10) read from the 
    `sortgrid.par` parameter file (radius is given in pixels).
    Arguments: 
    Calibration *cal pointer to calibration parameters
    Control *cpar pointer to control parameters
    nfix is the integer number of points in the calibration text file 
    vec3d fix[] structure 3d positions and integer identification pointers of 
    the calibration target points in the calibration file
    num is the number of detected (by image processing) dots on the calibration image
    Output:
    target sorted_pix[] is the array of targets or detected dots that have an ID (pnr), 
    pixel position, size of the dot, sum of grey values and another identification (tnr)
    the pnr pointer is the row number of the dot in the calibration block file
