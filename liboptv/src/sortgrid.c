Description:	       	reads objects, detected by detection etc.,
		       	sorts them with respect to the 13 wires of the grid,
		       	detects missing points
		       	and writes the result to  a new file
			
		       	does not work in each imaginable case !

/* 
    nearest_pixel_location () converts the positions of 3d points provided for calibration
    in a calibration file (fix) to the image space for each camera in order to present
    those on a screen for user interaction. Used only in "show initial guess" without
    sorting or finding the corresponding points like in sortgrid_man
    Arguments: 
    Calibration *cal points to calibration parameters
    Control *cpar points to control parameters
    nfix is the integer number of points in the calibration text files or number of files 
    if the calibration is multiplane. 
    vec3d fix[] array of doubles of 3D positions of the calibration target points
    num is the number of detected (by image processing) dots on the calibration image
    i_cam is the integer number of the camera
    Output:
    vec2d calib_points[] structure of floating pixel positions (.x, .y) corresponding 
    to the 3D points in structure fix.

/* sortgrid () is sorting detected target points by back-projection. Three dimensional 
    positions of the dots on the calibration target are provided with the known IDs. The 
    points are back-projected onto the image space and the nearest neighbour dots 
    identified by image processing routines are selected and sorted according to the 
    pre-defined IDs. The one to one correspondence provides a data on which the 
    calibration process is based on. The nearest neighbour search is a primitive 
    minimum distance search within a pre-defined radius (default = 10) read from the 
    `sortgrid.par` parameter file (radius is given in pixels).
    Arguments: 
    Calibration *cal pointer to calibration parameters
    Control *cpar pointer to control parameters
    nfix is the integer number of points in the calibration text file 
    vec3d fix[] structure 3d positions and integer identification pointers of 
    the calibration target points in the calibration file
    num is the number of detected (by image processing) dots on the calibration image
    Output:
    target pix[] is the array of targets or detected dots that have an ID (pnr), pixel 
    position, size of the dot, sum of grey values and another identification (tnr)
